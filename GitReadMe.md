This file was created during a Git and Github tutorial on Sunday, January 16
by Osayi Omo-Iyamu for CS257: Software Design. A respository has been created
in addition, also as part of the tutorial. 

This file will be used to practice editing, staging, and commiting files,
as well as other interactions with the git repository.
